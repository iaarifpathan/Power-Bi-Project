# Optimizing Social Media Ad Campaign Performance (2025)

### Project Overview
This repository contains the Hack Studio Hackathon project titled "Optimizing Social Media Ad Campaign Performance (2025)" organized by BlockseBlock. The project focuses on analyzing TrendWave’s social media ad campaigns across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn to enhance audience engagement and improve Return on Investment (ROI).

### Project Goals
Provide actionable insights into platform performance and audience behavior.
Optimize ad campaign budgets for better ROI.
Identify the most effective demographic segments for targeting.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- CTR (Click-Through Rate): DIVIDE([TotalClicks], [TotalImpressions], 0)
- CPL (Cost per Lead): DIVIDE([TotalSpent], [TotalLeads], 0)
- CPA (Cost per Acquisition): DIVIDE([TotalSpent], [TotalApprovals], 0)
- CPC (Cost per Click): DIVIDE([TotalSpent], [TotalClicks], 0)
- CPM (Cost per Mille): DIVIDE([TotalSpent] * 1000, [TotalImpressions], 0)

### Insights and Analysis
Problem Statement 1: Budget Allocation and Efficiency
- Total Spend by Age & Gender: Females aged 45–49 lead with the highest spend (13.4K), followed by males and females in the 30–34 age group. However, spend is heavily skewed toward older females and younger males.

- CPA by Age & Gender: Females 45–49 have the highest CPA (~120), indicating low ROI, while males 30–34 show the lowest CPA (~28), making them the most cost-efficient.

** Key Insight: High spend on 45–49 females does not translate to high efficiency. Reallocate budget to males 30–34 for better ROI. **


Problem Statement 2: Engagement vs. Conversion
- CTR and Conversion Rates: Males 30–34 achieve the highest conversion rate (19%), while females 45–49, despite a high CTR (~0.025%), convert poorly (4%).

** Key Insight: High CTR (e.g., females 45–49) does not guarantee conversions. Males 30–34 offer the best balance of engagement and conversion. **

Problem Statement 3: Cost Efficiency
- CPA vs. CPM: Males 30–34 exhibit the lowest CPA (25) and CPM, making them the most cost-efficient. Females 45–49, with high CPA (120) and CPM, are the least efficient.

** Key Insight: Focus on low CPA and CPM segments (males 30–34) and reduce investment in high-cost, low-ROI groups (females 45–49). **


### Recommendations
** Budget Optimization: Shift focus from older female segments (45–49) to younger males (30–34) and 
moderately efficient females (30–34, 35–39). **

** Strategic Targeting: Prioritize demographics with low CPM and high conversion rates for maximum ROI. **
